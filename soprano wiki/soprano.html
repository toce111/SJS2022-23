    <h1>The Sopranos</h1>
    <h5><b><i>- from enduring TV hit to the hottest show of lockdown</i></b></h5>

    <p>
        <b>The Sopranos</b> is an <b>American crime drama</b> television series created by <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chase" target="_blank"><b>David Chase</b></a>. The story revolves
        around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Soprano" target="_blank"><b>Tony Soprano</b></a> (James
        Gandolfini), a New Jersey-based Italian-American mobster, portraying his difficulties as he tries to balance
        family life with his role as leader of a criminal organization. These are explored during his therapy sessions
        with psychiatrist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Melfi" target="_blank"><b>Jennifer
                Melfi</b></a> (Lorraine Bracco). The series features Tony's family members, mafia colleagues, and rivals
        in prominent roles—most notably his wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmela_Soprano"
            target="_blank"><b>Carmela</b></a> (Edie Falco) and his protégé/distant cousin <a

                Moltisanti</b></a> (Michael Imperioli).
    </p>
    <p>
        The pilot was ordered in <b>1997</b>, and the show premiered on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO"
            target="_blank"><b>HBO</b></a> on January 10, 1999. The series ran for six seasons totaling <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Sopranos_episodes" target="_blank"><b>86 episodes</b></a>
        until June 10, 2007. Broadcast syndication followed in the U.S. and internationally. The Sopranos was produced
        by HBO, Chase Films, and Brad Grey Television. It was primarily filmed at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City
        in Queens, New York City and on location in New Jersey. The executive producers throughout the show's run were
        David Chase, Brad Grey, Robin Green, Mitchell Burgess, Ilene S. Landress, Terence Winter, and Matthew Weiner.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Sopranos is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential television series of all time. The
        series won a multitude of awards, including Peabody Awards for its first two seasons, 21 Primetime Emmy Awards,
        and five Golden Globe Awards. It has been the subject of critical analysis, controversy, and parody, and has
        spawned books, a video game, soundtrack albums, podcasts and assorted merchandise. Several members of the show's
        cast and crew were largely unknown to the public but have since had successful careers. In 2013, the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America_West" target="_blank"><b>Writers Guild of
                America</b></a> named The Sopranos the best-written TV series of all time, while <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide" target="_blank"><b>TV Guide</b></a> ranked it the best
        television series of all time. In 2016 and 2022, the series ranked first in the <a

        In March 2018, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Line_Cinema" target="_blank"><b>New Line
                Cinema</b></a> announced that they had purchased a film detailing The Sopranos background story,
        set in the 1960s and 1970s during, and in the wake of, the Newark riots. The 2021 film, <a

    <h2>Premise</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Primarily set in New Jersey and New York City, the series follows Tony Soprano, a North Jersey-based
        Italian-American mobster, who tries to balance his family life with his role as boss of the Soprano family.
        Suffering from panic attacks, Tony engages in therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi off and on
        throughout the series. Tony eventually finds himself at odds with his uncle Junior, his wife Carmela, other
        mobsters within the Soprano family, and the New York City-based <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupertazzi_family" target="_blank"><b>Lupertazzi</b></a> family, putting
        his life at risk.</p>

    <h2>Production</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3><b>Conception</b></h3>
    <p>David Chase had worked as a television writer and producer for more than 20 years before creating The Sopranos.
        He had been employed as a staff writer or producer for several television series, including Kolchak: The Night
        Stalker, Switch, The Rockford Files, I'll Fly Away, and Northern Exposure. He had also co-created the
        short-lived original series Almost Grown in 1988. He made his television directorial debut in 1986 with the
        "Enough Rope for Two" episode of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock_Presents_(1985_TV_series)" target="_blank"><b>Alfred
                Hitchcock Presents</b></a>. He also directed episodes of Almost Grown and I'll Fly Away in 1988 and
        1992, respectively. In 1996, he wrote and directed the television film The Rockford Files: Punishment and Crime.
        He served as showrunner for I'll Fly Away and Northern Exposure in the 1990s. Chase won his first Emmy Award in
        1978 for his work on The Rockford Files (shared with fellow producers) and his second for writing the 1980
        television film Off the Minnesota Strip. By 1996, he was a coveted showrunner.</p>
    <p>
        The story of The Sopranos was initially conceived as a feature film about "a mobster in therapy having problems
        with his mother". Chase got some input from his manager <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Braun"
            target="_blank"><b>Lloyd Braun</b></a> and decided to adapt it into a television series. He signed a
        development deal in 1995 with production company Brillstein-Grey and wrote the original pilot script. He drew
        heavily from his personal life and his experiences growing up in New Jersey, and has stated that he tried to
        apply his own "family dynamic to mobsters". For instance, the tumultuous relationship between series protagonist
        Tony Soprano and his mother Livia is partially based on Chase's relationship with his own mother. He was also in
        psychotherapy at the time and modeled the character of Jennifer Melfi after his own psychiatrist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chase had been fascinated by organized crime and the mafia from an early age, witnessing such people growing up.
        He also was raised on classic gangster films such as The Public Enemy and the crime series <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Untouchables_(1959_TV_series)" target="_blank"><b>The
                Untouchables</b></a>. The series is partly inspired by the Richard Boiardo family, a prominent New
        Jersey organized crime family when Chase was growing up, and partly on New Jersey's DeCavalcante family. He has
        mentioned American playwrights Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams as influences on the show's writing, and
        Italian director Federico Fellini as an important influence on the show's cinematic style. The series was named
        after high school friends of his.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chase and producer Brad Grey pitched The Sopranos to several networks; <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company" target="_blank"><b>Fox</b></a> showed interest
        but passed on it after Chase presented them the pilot script. They eventually pitched the show to Chris
        Albrecht, president of HBO Original Programming, who decided to finance a pilot episode which was shot in 1997.
        Chase directed it himself. They finished the pilot and showed it to HBO executives, but the show was put on hold
        for several months.
    </p>
    <p>
        During this time, Chase, who had experienced frustration for a long period with being unable to break out of the
        TV genre and into film, considered asking HBO for additional funding to shoot 45 more minutes of footage and
        release The Sopranos as a feature film. In December 1997, HBO decided to produce the series and ordered 12 more
        episodes for a 13-episode season. The show premiered on HBO on January 10, 1999, with the pilot, The Sopranos.
    </p>
    <h4><i>Baer v. Chase</i></h4>
    <p>
        North Jersey prosecutor and municipal judge Robert Baer filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Chase in <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton,_New_Jersey" target="_blank"><b>Trenton</b></a>, New Jersey
        federal court, alleging that he helped to create the show. Baer lost the suit, but he won a ruling that a jury
        should decide how much he should be paid for services as a location scout, researcher, and story consultant.
        Baer argued that he had introduced Chase to Tony Spirito, a restaurateur and gambler with alleged mob ties, and
        Thomas Koczur, a homicide detective for the Elizabeth, New Jersey Police Department. Chase had conducted
        interviews and tours with both, which strongly inspired some characters, settings, and storylines portrayed in
        The Sopranos. On December 19, 2007, a federal jury found against Baer, dismissing all of his claims.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Casting</b></h3>
    <p>
        Many of the actors on The Sopranos are Italian American, like the characters they portray, and many appeared
        together in films and television series before joining the cast of The Sopranos. The series has 27 actors in
        common with the 1990 Martin Scorsese gangster film Goodfellas, including main cast members Lorraine Bracco,
        Michael Imperioli, and Tony Sirico.
    </p>
    <p>
        The casting directors were Georgianne Walken and Sheila Jaffe. The main cast was put together through a process
        of auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael
        Imperioli beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti; he said that Chase had "a poker face,
        so I thought he wasn't into me, and he kept giving me notes and having me try it again, which often is a sign
        that you're not doing it right." Chase said that he wanted Imperioli because of his performance in Goodfellas.
    </p>
    <p>
        James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald
        saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film True Romance. Lorraine Bracco played the role of mob wife
        Karen Hill in Goodfellas, and she was originally asked to play the role of Carmela Soprano. She took the role of
        Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt that the part of the highly
        educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico had a criminal history, and he signed on to
        play Paulie Walnuts so long as his character was not to be a "rat". Sirico had originally auditioned for the
        role of Uncle Junior with Frank Vincent, but Dominic Chianese landed the role.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chase was impressed with Steven Van Zandt's humorous appearance and presence after seeing him induct The Rascals
        into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, and invited him to audition. Van Zandt, a guitarist in Bruce
        Springsteen's E Street Band, had never acted before. He auditioned for the role of Tony Soprano, but HBO felt
        that the role should go to an experienced actor, so Chase wrote a new part for him. Van Zandt eventually agreed
        to star on the show as consigliere Silvio Dante, and his real-life spouse Maureen was cast as his on-screen wife
        Gabriella.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cast of the debut season of the series consisted of largely unknown actors, with the exception of Bracco,
        Chianese, and Nancy Marchand, but many cast members were noted for their acting ability and received mainstream
        attention for their performances. Subsequent seasons saw established actors Joe Pantoliano, Robert Loggia, Steve
        Buscemi, and Frank Vincent join the starring cast, along with well-known actors in recurring roles such as Peter
        Bogdanovich, John Heard, Robert Patrick, Peter Riegert, Annabella Sciorra, and David Strathairn.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several well-known actors appeared in one or two episodes, such as Lauren Bacall, Daniel Baldwin, Annette
        Bening, Polly Bergen, Sandra Bernhard, Charles S. Dutton, Jon Favreau, Janeane Garofalo, Hal Holbrook, Tim Kang,
        Elias Koteas, Ben Kingsley, Linda Lavin, Ken Leung, Julianna Margulies, Sydney Pollack, Wilmer Valderrama,
        Alicia Witt, and Burt Young. Ray Liotta, who was eventually cast as two of the Moltisanti brothers in The Many
        Saints of Newark film prequel, was approached by Chase at one point to appear in third or fourth seasons of the
        show, but the plan didn't work out.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Crew</b></h3>
    <p>
        Series creator and executive producer David Chase served as showrunner and head writer for the production of all
        six seasons of the show. He was deeply involved with the general production of every episode and is noted for
        being a very controlling, demanding, and specific producer. He wrote or co-wrote between two and seven episodes
        per season and would oversee all the editing, consult with episode directors, give actors character motivation,
        approve casting choices and set designs, and do extensive but uncredited rewrites of episodes written by others.
        Brad Grey served as executive producer alongside Chase but had no creative input on the show. Many members of
        the creative team behind The Sopranos were handpicked by Chase, some being old friends and colleagues of his;
        others were selected after interviews conducted by producers of the show.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the show's writers worked in television before joining the writing staff of The Sopranos. The writing
        team and married couple Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess worked on the series as writers and producers from the
        first to the fifth season; they had previously worked with Chase on Northern Exposure. Terence Winter joined the
        writing staff during the production of the second season and served as executive producer from season five
        onwards. He practiced law for two years before deciding to pursue a career as a screenwriter, and he caught the
        attention of Chase through writer Frank Renzulli.
    </p>
    <p>
        Matthew Weiner served as staff writer and producer for the show's fifth and sixth seasons. He wrote a script for
        the series Mad Men in 2000 which was passed on to Chase, who was so impressed that he immediately offered Weiner
        a job as a writer for The Sopranos. Cast members Michael Imperioli and Toni Kalem portray Christopher Moltisanti
        and Angie Bonpensiero respectively, and they also wrote episodes for the show. Imperioli wrote five episodes of
        seasons two through five, and Kalem wrote one episode of season five.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other writers included Frank Renzulli, Todd A. Kessler (co-creator of Damages), writing team Diane Frolov and
        Andrew Schneider who worked with Chase on Northern Exposure, and Lawrence Konner, who co-created Almost Grown
        with Chase in 1988. In total, 20 writers or writing teams are credited with writing episodes of The Sopranos. Of
        these, Tim Van Patten and Maria Laurino receive a single story credit, and eight others are credited with
        writing a sole episode. The most prolific writers of the series were Chase (30 credited episodes, including
        story credits), Winter (25 episodes), Green and Burgess (22 episodes), Weiner (12 episodes), and Renzulli (9
        episodes).
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the directors had previously worked on television series and independent films. The most frequent
        directors of the series were Tim Van Patten (20 episodes), John Patterson (13 episodes), Allen Coulter (12
        episodes), and Alan Taylor (9 episodes), all of whom have a background in television. Recurring cast members
        Steve Buscemi and Peter Bogdanovich also directed episodes of the series intermittently. Chase directed the
        pilot episode and the series finale. Both episodes were photographed by the show's original director of
        photography Alik Sakharov, who later alternated episodes with Phil Abraham. The show's photography and directing
        is noted for its feature film quality. This look was achieved by Chase collaborating with Sakharov. "From the
        pilot, we would sit down with the whole script and break the scenes down into shots. That's what you do with
        feature films."
    </p>
    <h3><b>Music</b></h3>
    <p><b>Main article: Music on The Sopranos</b></p>
    <p>
        The Sopranos is noted for its eclectic music selections and has received considerable critical attention for its
        effective use of previously recorded songs. Chase personally selected all of the show's music with producer
        Martin Bruestle and music editor Kathryn Dayak, sometimes also consulting Steven Van Zandt. The music was
        usually selected once the production and editing of an episode was completed, but on occasion sequences were
        filmed to match preselected pieces of music.
    </p>
    <p>
        The show's opening theme is "Woke Up This Morning" (Chosen One Mix), written by, remixed and performed by
        British band Alabama 3. With few exceptions, a different song plays over the closing credits of each episode.
        Many songs are repeated multiple times through an episode, such as "Living on a Thin Line" by The Kinks in the
        season three episode "University" and "Glad Tidings" by Van Morrison in the season five finale "All Due
        Respect". Other songs are heard several times throughout the series. A notable example is "Con te partirò",
        performed by Italian singer Andrea Bocelli, which plays several times in relation to the character of Carmela
        Soprano. While the show utilizes a wealth of previously recorded music, it is also notable for its lack of
        originally composed incidental music, compared with other television programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two soundtrack albums containing music from the series have been released. The first, titled The Sopranos: Music
        from the HBO Original Series, was released in 1999. It contains selections from the show's first two seasons and
        reached #54 on the U.S. Billboard 200. A second soundtrack compilation titled The Sopranos – Peppers and Eggs:
        Music From The HBO Series, was released in 2001. This double-disc album contains songs and selected dialogue
        from the show's first three seasons. It reached #38 on the U.S. Billboard 200.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Sets and location</b></h3>
    <p>
        The majority of the exterior scenes taking place in New Jersey were filmed on location, with the majority of the
        interior shots filmed at Silvercup Studios in New York City, including most indoor shots of the Soprano
        residence, the back room of the strip club Bada Bing!, and Dr. Melfi's office. The pork store was called
        Centanni's Meat Market in the pilot episode, an actual butchery in Elizabeth, New Jersey. After the series was
        picked up by HBO, the producers leased a building with a storefront in Kearny, New Jersey which served as the
        shooting location for exterior and interior scenes for the remainder of production; renamed Satriale's Pork
        Store. After the series ended, the building was demolished.
    </p>
    <p>
        The strip club Bada Bing! was owned and operated by Silvio Dante on the show, and is an actual strip club on
        Route 17 in Lodi, New Jersey. Exteriors and interiors were shot on location except for the back room. The club
        is called Satin Dolls and was an existing business before the show started. The club continued to operate during
        the eight years that the show was filmed there, and a business arrangement was worked out with the owner.
        Locations manager Mark Kamine recalls that the owner was "very gracious" as long as the shooting did not
        "conflict with his business time".
    </p>
    <p>
        Scenes set at the restaurant Vesuvio, owned and operated in the series by character Artie Bucco, were filmed at
        a restaurant called Manolo's located in Elizabeth for the first episode. After the destruction of Vesuvio within
        the context of the series, Artie opened a new restaurant called Nuovo Vesuvio; exterior scenes set there were
        filmed at an Italian restaurant called Punta Dura located in Long Island City. All the exterior and some
        interior shots of the Soprano residence were filmed on location at a private residence in North Caldwell, New
        Jersey.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Title sequence</b></h3>
    <p>
        Tony Soprano is seen emerging from the Lincoln Tunnel and passing through the tollbooth for the New Jersey
        Turnpike. Numerous landmarks in and around Newark and Jersey City, New Jersey, are then shown passing by the
        camera as Tony drives down the highway. The sequence ends with Tony pulling into the driveway of his suburban
        home. Chase has said that the goal of the title sequence was to show that this particular mafia show was about
        New Jersey, as opposed to New York, where most similar dramas have been set.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the first three seasons, between Tony leaving the tunnel and passing through the toll plaza, the show had a
        shot of the World Trade Center towers in Tony's right side-view mirror. After the September 11 attacks, this

    <p>
        The Sopranos features a large cast of characters, many of whom get significant amounts of character development.
        Some only appear in certain seasons, while others appear (sporadically or constantly) throughout the entire
        series. All characters were created by David Chase unless otherwise noted.

        Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is the series's protagonist. Tony is one of the capos of the New Jersey-based
        DiMeo crime family, at the beginning of the series; he eventually becomes its undisputed boss. He is also the
        patriarch of the Soprano household. Throughout the series, Tony struggles to balance the conflicting
        requirements of his family with those of the Mafia family he controls. Because he is prone to bouts of clinical
        depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment by
        psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode.

        She treats Tony to the best of her ability even though they routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is
        usually thoughtful, rational, and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer,
        occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too,
        but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client and naively
        assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.

        Adding to Tony's complicated life is his relationship with his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), which is strained by
        his constant infidelity and her struggle to reconcile the reality of Tony's business, of which she is often in
        denial, with the affluent lifestyle and higher social status it brings her. Both have up-and-down relationships
        with their two children: the intelligent-but-rebellious Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and underachiever Anthony
        Jr. ("A.J.") (Robert Iler), whose everyday teenage issues are further complicated by their eventual knowledge of
        their father's criminal activities and reputation.

        The starring cast includes members of Tony's extended family, including: his disapproving, manipulative mother,
        Livia (Nancy Marchand); his aimless, histrionic older sister, Janice (Aida Turturro); his paternal uncle Corrado
        "Junior" Soprano (Dominic Chianese), nominal boss of the crime family following the death of then-acting boss
        Jackie Aprile Sr. (Michael Rispoli); his maternal cousin Tony Blundetto (Steve Buscemi); and Christopher
        Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli), who is often referred to as Tony's "nephew", but is actually his cousin by
        marriage.
